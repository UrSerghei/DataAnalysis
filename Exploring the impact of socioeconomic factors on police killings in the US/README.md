# Police Killings in the USA: Data Analysis and Visualization

This project provides an in-depth analysis and visualization of police killings in the United States. By leveraging various datasets and employing data visualization techniques, we aim to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights related to poverty rates, high school graduation rates, racial demographics, mental health, and more in the context of police-related fatalities.
